					  <h5>Communication message and objectives:</h5>
                    <h6>Papillion is an all-day high-end fashion brand. Making 100% sustainable clothing. 
						Our brand is based in Breda.</h6>
						<h5>Reach objective:</h5>
						<h6>For our Reach Objective, we want to have over 300 followers on our social media.</h6> 
						<h5>Affect objective:</h5>
						<h6>We want our target audience to feel excited when looking at our brand, we want to inspire them to be themselves and dress however they want.</h6>
						<h5>Response objective:</h5>
						<h6>The response we expect from our target audience is to follow our social media platform, share our brand with friends and family, and get involved with the identity of the brand.</h6>
							Target audience:
					  <p>Our target audience is males and females between the age of 18 to 24 in the Netherlands.</p>
						<p><strong>Demographics and lifestyle:</strong></p>
						<div class="container">
							<p>Students, Young workers, all genders, all ethnicities</p>
						<p>High income (around 2000euros per month)</p>
						<p>Social people who like to go out and party</p>
						<p>Creative people who like to express themselves with the way they dress.</p>
						<p><strong>Values and Interests:</strong></p>
						<p>Creative, Outgoing people, social people, Unique personalities, fashion-oriented people</p>
						<p>Interest: going out to parties, fashion addicts, sneakers, luxuries lifestyles</p> 
						<p><strong>Media Behavior:</strong></p>
						<p>To find out a bit more about our target market I have conducted a survey for them to fill in. The goal of this survey was to find out their favorite social media and a bit more about their buying behavior when it comes to clothes. Most participants were teenagers and young adults. The most used social media is Instagram. They spent an average of 6 hours a day on social media. Instagram is the best social media to socialize between your friends, share content, keep up with the fashions trends and entertain themselves.</p> 
						<p><strong>Media tactics:</strong></p>
						<p>So based on the survey and research we will use Instagram as the social media to promote and create awareness for our brand. Instagram is the most used social media by our target audience. Even though our target audience also uses other platforms we will focus only on Instagram as the majority is on it.
						Instagram is also one of the platforms with the most interactions so we think that it might be the most appropriate social media to do our campaign and be able to reach our objective. Instagram has multiple functionalities that will help us track our progress.
						I provided some screenshots of the survey and as we can see Instagram is the social media used the most by our target market.</p>

					 	 <p>some people like to shop online or in a specific store they are used to going to for a long time.</p>
						<p><strong>Planning:</strong></p>
						<p>Here is the content planning for our Instagram page:
						We have decided to upload at 2 pm because it is the time our target audience is the most active on Instagram.</p>
							  <div class= "containter"><a class="gallery" href="assets/images/aapapillon/contentplan.PNG"><img src="assets/images/aapapillon/contentplan.PNG" alt="Papillon" width="500" height="100"/></a>
					  	<p><strong>Learning Points:</strong></p>
						<p>During this project, we learned to make a marketing campaign for a brand that we created.
						In our plan we have tried to advertise our brand via the Instagram tool. This did not go exactly as planned as we encountered problems with our account and Instagram did not let us use their advertising tool. Next time we will need to do deeper research on why Instagram blocked our account. We are still proud of our campaign as we got a lot of feedback from people saying that they liked the aesthetic and the design of our page. This has helped us a lot as it created a considerable number of interactions with our social media page.</p>
						<p><strong>Future Planning:</strong></p>
						<p>So far in our project, we have managed to create some awareness around our brand. We have been able to create this awareness through multiples post where we showed the values and vision of our brand. People have also been able to see some of the designs of our sweaters on our social media. We have been able to reach our goal of having over 300 followers on our social media page.</p>
						<p>Here is a screenshot of our Instagram page.</p>
						 <div class= "containter "><a class="gallery col-xs-12 col-md-6" href="assets/images/aapapillon/marketingone.jpg"><img src="assets/images/aapapillon/marketingone.jpg" alt="Papillon" width="500" height="100"/></a>
						 <div class= "containter"><a class="gallery" href="assets/images/aapapillon/marketingtwo.jpg"><img src="assets/images/aapapillon/marketingtwo.jpg" alt="Papillon" width="500" height="100"/></a>
						<p>In the future, we would like to keep posting pictures of our different sweaters while keeping the aesthetics we created. We will also develop the NFT aspect of our company by releasing the full collection of NFT after sharing the whole collection of sweaters.
						We are quite satisfied with our work so far but there is room for improvement. Next time we should be a bit more consistent with the posting of our products. People like to see the full collections of sweaters quickly and not have to wait a few days between the posts. We have realized and therefore posted with more consistency afterward.</p>
